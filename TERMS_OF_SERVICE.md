## 4. AI-Generated Content

### What It Is
When you save a reflection, AI analyzes your text and generates personalized challenges. These are categorized into life areas: Health, Career, Finance, Relationships, Personal Growth, Fun, Environment, and Spirituality.

### Important Limitations

**AI challenges are suggestions, not instructions.**

- Challenges may occasionally be irrelevant or unhelpful

- AI does not know your full situation

**Not Professional Advice**

Improvify does not provide and is not a substitute for:

- Professional counseling or therapy

If you're struggling with mental health, please contact a qualified professional or crisis helpline.

## 5. Streaks, XP, and Gamification

### How It Works

- XP determines your level (1-9)
- Daily reflections build streaks
- Streak shields can protect your streak

### No Monetary Value
XP, levels, streaks, and shields have no monetary value and cannot be exchanged, sold, or transferred.

### Changes
We may adjust the gamification system (XP values, level thresholds, etc.) at any time without notice.

## 6. Themes

Improvify offers different themes (Classic, Faith, Stoic, Minimalist) that affect:

Themes are cosmetic preferences. Choosing a theme does not guarantee challenges will always align with that philosophy.
